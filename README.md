## What It Is
Book-A-Cook is an app designed to help folks who miss their mother’s or grandmother’s cooking, or a loved one’s cooking-- to make them feel at home, away from home.
<br />
It is perfect way for someone who’s missing home cooked food to leaf through a selection of cooks on the app and choose a cuisine based on location (where the food originates from), heartiness level (more heavier-based foods), and type of food (i.e. seafood).

## Motivation
